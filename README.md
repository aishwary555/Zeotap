**eCommerce Transactions Analysis**
This repository contains the implementation of data analysis and modeling tasks for an eCommerce transactions dataset. The project focuses on three main tasks:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights.
Lookalike Model: Build a model to recommend similar customers based on profile and transaction history.
Customer Segmentation: Perform clustering to group customers into meaningful segments.


Files
EDA.ipynb: Code for data analysis and insights generation.
Lookalike.ipynb: Code for the lookalike model and recommendations.
Clustering.ipynb: Code for customer segmentation and cluster visualization.
Lookalike.csv: Top 3 similar customers with similarity scores for the first 20 customers.


Tools and Techniques
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, etc.)
Clustering and Cosine Similarity
Data Standardization and Aggregation
